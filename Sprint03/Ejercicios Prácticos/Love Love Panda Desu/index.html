		<h2>About Pandas</h2>
		<p>The gian panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, literally "black and white cat-foot"; Chinese: pinyin da xion mao, literally "big bear cat") also known as panda bear or simply pandaisa bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large distincive black patches aroudn its eyes, over the earse and across its roun body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it fro the unrelated red panda. Thought it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tybers or even meat in the form of birds, rodents o carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges or bananas alogn with specially prepared food.</p>
